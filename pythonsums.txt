Ans:-

#Lets get the input age from the user
age=int(input("Enter your age:"))
#lets make the program to allow if the age is above 18 then to allow vote, else
#tell them about the eligiblity.
if age>18:
    print("Eligible to vote")
else:
    print("Your age should be atleast 18 complete to vote")

2)Write a program to display"Hello" if the number given by the user is the multiple of 5 else print"Bye
Ans:

a = int(input("Enter the number:"))
if a % 5 == 0:
    print("Hello")
else:
    print("Bye")


3)Write a programm to calculate the electricity bill(accept number of unit as input from user)according to the following criteria
    Units           - Amount
    100             -No cost/free
    next 100        -5/unit
    next 100        -10/unit

Ans:
amount=0
unit=int(input("Enter the unit consumed:"))
if unit<101:
    amount=0
elif 100<unit<201:
    amount=(unit-100)*5
elif 200<unit:
    amount=500+(unit-200)*10
print("The cost to pay for the consumed unit is:",amount)

4)Write a program to display the last digit of a number?
Ans:
a=int(input("Enter the number:"))
c=a%10
print("The last digit of the number is: ",c)

5)Write a program to check whether the last digit of a number given by user is divisible by 3 or not?
Ans: 

a=int(input("Enter the number:"))
b=a%10
if b%3==0:
    print("Divisible by 3")
else:
    print("Not divisible by 3")

6)Write a program to accept percentage from user and display the grade according to the following criteria:

Marks           - grade
>90             -A
>80-<=90        -B 
>=60->=80       -c 
Below 60        -D 

Ans:
marks=int(input("Enter your mark:"))
if 101>marks>90:
    print("Grade is A")
elif 80<marks<=90:
    print("Grade is B")
elif 60<marks<=80:
    print("Grade is C")
elif 0<marks<60:
    print("Grade is D")

7)Write a program to accept cost price of a bike and display the road tax to be paid according to the criteria:

Cost price(Rs)          -tax
>100000                  -15%
>50000 and <=100000     -10%
<=50000                 -5%

Ans:
tax=0
bike_cost=int(input("Enter your bike cost:"))
if bike_cost>100000:
    tax=(bike_cost*15/100)
elif 100000>=bike_cost>=50000:
    tax=(bike_cost*10/100)
elif bike_cost<50000:
    tax=(bike_cost*5/100)
print("The tax for your bike is ",tax)

8)Write a program to check a year whether it is leap or not?

year=int(input("Enter the year:"))
if (year%4==0 and year%100!=0) or (year%400==0):
    print("The year you entered is the leap year.")
else:
    print("The year you entered is not the leap year")

9)Write a program to accept a number from 1 to 12 and display the name of the month and days in that month like
1 for January and number of days 31 and so on.

10)Write the logical expression of the following:
A is greater than B and C is greater than D

    monument="Taj Mahal"
elif city=="Jaipur":
    monument="Jal Mahal"
print("The monument in the city is: ",monument)

12)Write a program to find a number whethe it is three digit or not?

Ans: 
a=int(input("Enter the number: "))
if 100<=a<=999:
    print("The number is three digit")
else:
    print("The number is not three digit")

    or

def is_three_digit(number):
    if 100 <= number <= 999:
        return True
    else:
        return False
# Example usage
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
if is_three_digit(num):
    print("The number is three digits.")
else:
    print("The number is not three digits.")
