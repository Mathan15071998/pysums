# Printing the oldest person's details
print(f"The oldest person is person {oldest_index+1} with an age of {oldest} years.")
 or 

 a=[]
for i in range(1,5):

elif a<b>c:
    print("The second number is the biggest among 2 which is ",b)
elif a<c>b:
    print("The final number entered is the largest which is ",c)

    or


num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))
num3 = float(input("Enter the third number: "))

if num1 >= num2 and num1 >= num3:
    largest = num1
elif num2 >= num1 and num2 >= num3:

#lets find who is the youngest
younger=min(a)
print("The younger person is with the age of ", younger)

#lets find and print the index of that person
index_younger=a.index(younger)
