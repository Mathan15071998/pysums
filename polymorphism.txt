                                                Polymorphism

        In programming, Polymorphism means the same function name(but different signatures ) used for different types.
 The key difference is the data types and number of arguments used in function.For instance,
def add(a,b,c=0):
    print(a+b+c)
add(10,40)
add(10,40,20)


"""Create a class called Animal with a method sound()
 that prints "Animal makes a sound." Create a derived class
 called Dog that inherits from Animal and overrides the sound() method to print
 "Dog Barks." Create another derived class called Bird that inherits from
 Animal and overrides the sound() method to print "Birds Sing"."""

class animal():
    def sound(self):
        print("Animal makes a sound")
class dog(animal):
    def sound(self):
        print("Dog barks")
class bird(animal):
    def sound(self):
        print("Birds sing")

a=animal()
a.sound()

b=dog()
b.sound()

c=bird()
c.sound()- this is also known as Polymorphism because one function overides another function based on the
location of the class.
