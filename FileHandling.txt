create a folder- create a file (.txt)
create a new python file and save it in the folder where file exist.

commands:

    variable=filename.txt
    print(variable)- will give like mode=r

    so we need to give the command of variable.read will help us to open and read the content.

    variable=filename.txt
    print(variable.read())


    now if I want to add something,

    variable.write()

    print(variable)- will give the mode of the file whether it's writeable or readable

    we can also change the mode by , variable=open("variable.txt","w")


    whenever the write() method used, older data will be replaced with new data
    variable.close()-to close the file


    "variable.extension","r+"- allows us to both read and write the file.



    f=open("fh.txt","a")
f.write("hi")
f.write("Hello")
f.close()

f=open("fh.txt","r+")
print(f.read())

here using a after the extension allows us to write the data without replacing the older data.

variable.readline()- allows us to print the first line in the file.
