                                Encapsulation
                                        
1)Private variables can be acceesed only by the functions within the class
  for an example,

class company():
    def __init__(self):
        self.companyname="Google"
c=company()
print(c.companyname)              -here output will be "Google"

to protect the companyname and prevent access to others, we need to protect the variable by making it private.

using "__" (double underscores before the variable will make it as a private. This could be only accessed 
by the functions within the same class.)


class company():
    def __init__(self):
        self.__companyname="Google"
    def display(self):
        print(self.__companyname)
c=company()
c.display()
print(c.__companyname)- output will be "Google" and through error for tried to access the private variable 
from outside of the class.

here if the variable like following then it's public.
self.companyname="Google"
